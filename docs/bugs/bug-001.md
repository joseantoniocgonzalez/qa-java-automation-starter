# BUG-001 — Login button not clickable in headless mode (intermittent)

## Environment
- App / URL: SauceDemo
- Browser: Chrome headless
- OS: CI runner / Linux
- Build/commit: N/A

## Severity / Priority
- Severity: S2 Major
- Priority: P1 High

## Preconditions
- Use valid credentials: standard_user / secret_sauce

## Steps to reproduce
1. Open SauceDemo login page in headless Chrome.
2. Enter username and password.
3. Click "Login".

## Expected result
Login button is clickable and user is redirected to inventory page.

## Actual result
Intermittently, click is ignored (no navigation). Test may time out waiting for inventory page.

## Evidence
- Screenshot + HTML source on failure (from automation artifacts)

## Notes
This is a typical timing/overlay-style symptom in headless runs. Consider verifying element is clickable and not covered; keep explicit waits.
