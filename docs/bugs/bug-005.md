# BUG-005 — API response schema mismatch (post fields types changed)

## Environment
- API: JSONPlaceholder (demo)
- Client: Newman
- OS: Any

## Severity / Priority
- Severity: S2 Major
- Priority: P2 Medium

## Preconditions
- Run API smoke collection

## Steps to reproduce
1. Run `GET /posts/1`.
2. Validate response against schema.

## Expected result
Response matches schema: object with userId(id) as number, title/body as string.

## Actual result
Schema validation fails (e.g., `id` is not a number or required field missing).

## Evidence
- Newman report HTML and JUnit XML showing failing assertion

## Notes
In real systems, schema mismatch indicates contract drift; coordinate with API owners.
